# SATS easter egg hunt

I have a 10 year old son, he's doing his (UK) SATS this year, it's also easter, so to give him a challenge I took questions off the 2016 question papers, hid 40 eggs around the house and built this quickly.

**If you see this before Good Friday 2017, please don't tell him where I hid the eggs.**

Yes, **I know the answers are available to the browser** - he's 10, if he can figure that out, then I don't care what he gets in his SATS!

It uses **local storage** to remember the responses in the browser, so your kids can play this over a while and not worry about the reloads/closes etc.

## Code quality
It's awful, it's a smashed up angular, bootstrap, lodash, markdown, json mess, don't judge me.
